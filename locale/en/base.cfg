[mod-setting-description]
YARM-ticks-between-checks=When a resource site is being monitored, the amount of resources in it is only updated once every N game ticks (60 ticks = 1 second), based on this value. Increase to hopefully improve UPS, at the cost of needing longer to update a site's estimates.
YARM-entities-per-tick=For resources that are being monitored, this controls how many resource entities (ore tiles) to query in a single tick (1 of the normally 60 updates every second). Reduce this to hopefully improve UPS.
YARM-overlay-step=Adding huge resource patches can cause FPS drop with large overlays.  Changing the sparseness of the overlay will reduce the FPS drop by having less entities. Set to 1 for full coverage, 2 for 1/4, 3 for 1/9, etc.
YARM-map-markers=Show markers on the map containing the site name and its current content, updating automatically. Note: after changing this setting, it may take a few seconds for the results to be visible!
YARM-warn-timeleft=The hours of remaining resources that will alert the player for a single resource site.
YARM-warn-timeleft_totals=The hours of remaining resources that will alert the player for the total lines which are displayed if there are multiple active sites for an ore type.
YARM-order-by=Change the display order of sites in the YARM list.
YARM-site-prefix-with-surface=Prefix the surface name to the site name. Useful for maps with multiple surfaces.
YARM-debug-profiling=When enabled, outputs some information about tick timing to the player output and factorio-current.log.
YARM-adjust-for-productivity=Amounts are shown adjusted by mining productivity research.
YARM-productivity-show-raw-and-adjusted=Amounts show both raw amount and amount adjusted by mining productivity research, one of them in parentheses (default: show the raw amount in parentheses).
YARM-productivity-parentheses-part-is=Change which amount (raw or adjusted for mining productivity) is shown in parentheses.
YARM-grow-limit=Maximum distance from the original center that a site may grow when it is created. -1 = Unlimited growth. 0 = No growth. More than 0 = Limited growth.
YARM-adjust-over-percentage-sites=When enabled sites will have their "initial amount" set to match the current amount, if the current amount of resources is more than the one noted initially. Can be used as a temporary fix or a permanent check.
YARM-nominal-ups=The number of updates per second that YARM will assume when calculating ETD and mining speeds. 60 is the default, but if your game is consistently running below the default, adjust this value to your average UPS to get more accurate estimates and speeds.
YARM-make-fake-ores=When enabled, YARM will create a phony item for each resource that, when placed, will create a mineable deposit of that resource. The items cannot be obtained. This is necessary for counting the number of ore entities while dragging the selection tool but may interact badly with other mods (e.g., AAI Programmable Structures) and is thus off by default.
YARM-hud-update-ticks=The HUD (the list of sites and their current status) must be refreshed periodically with information about the existing sites. This controls how often it happens. The value is expressed in ticks (60 ticks = 1 second).
